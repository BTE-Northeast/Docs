# Flat
The most basic of all roofs. Depending on the specific building, it can vary a little. If your roof has a "slope" it might be a [shed roof](./shed).

- Go inside the exterior walls
- Make sure your legs are one block below the top of the exterior walls
- Use the command below with a [block ID](id) or pattern of block IDs, making sure there are no holes in the walls at the y level of your legs. Do not use a radius larger than 100

```
//fill <block-ID> <radius>
```

# Measuring

```eval_rst
.. caution::

    This page is **not** for adjusting terrain, it is for measuring heights of walls and windows, lengths of roof elements, etc

```

## Google Earth Pro

*A computer is required*

```eval_rst
.. attention::

    :ref:`Estimate` for small things such as suburban windows. **If it's small and you can estimate it, estimate it**

```

1. Download and install [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro)
2. Follow the video below: (You cannot use this technique in street view, Google Maps, or web based Google Earth)

```eval_rst
.. tip:: 

    | ``Scroll Wheel``: Zoom in/out
    | ``Left Click + Drag``: Pan around
    | ``Left Click + CTRL + Drag``: Rotate up/down/counter-clockwise/clockwise

## Estimate

By applying logic and experience you will gain, you can estimate the sizes of most things based on street view/images. Estimating is best done through street view, photo spheres, or normal photos.

```eval_rst
.. important:: 
    
    When estimating, always keep in mind ONE meter cubed IRL is ONE block in Minecraft

```

Use doors, cars, humans, and other objects you know the size of, then mentally or through photo editing software, compare them to the object you are trying to measure.

### Example

```eval_rst
.. image:: ../_static/measure/measure-with-door-house.jpeg
    :width: 700
    :alt: Suburban house

```

Although not all doors are 2 meters tall, this door is clearly a typical door of a suburban house, and is 2 meters tall, therefore 2 blocks tall. By comparing the door to the window on the left, we can tell the height of the window is half the height of the door, and therefore 1 block tall. Using the same logic the window is 2 blocks wide, the window on the right is 1.5 blocks tall, and the windows on the second floor are 1 block wide, 1 block tall.
